# 🧈 Amul Website Redesign — Hackathon Project

## ⚖️ Before vs After: Amul Original Website vs My Redesign

| Feature / Area | Original Amul Website | My Redesigned Version |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Overall Look** | Outdated layout with dense text and inconsistent spacing | Modern, clean, and airy layout with clear spacing and hierarchy |
| **Color Scheme** | Overuse of bright red and inconsistent tones | Balanced red-blue-white palette with better contrast and brand consistency |
| **Typography** | Small, hard-to-read fonts and inconsistent sizes | Modern, legible Google Fonts (Poppins) with consistent hierarchy |
| **Navigation** | Cluttered top menu and too many links | Simplified 5-link navigation with clear call-to-action (Contact button) |
| **Home Page** | Image-heavy and cluttered | Balanced hero section with tagline, product highlights, and key info cards |
| **Product Display** | Text-based product listings | Card-based product grid with hover effects and visual hierarchy |
| **Responsiveness** | Poor mobile layout | Fully responsive (CSS Grid + Flexbox), optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops |
| **Contact Page** | Plain text info only | Interactive contact form with labeled fields and accessible structure |
| **UX Improvements** | No clear flow or focus areas | Improved information grouping, visual storytelling, and stronger CTAs |
